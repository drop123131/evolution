# The Evolution

The Evolution is a minimalistic multi-purpose block theme for WordPress. It was designed specially for blogs and personal portifolios. It also can be used in small business and another projects. Fully responsible to adapt to any screen size, it includes footer with social widgets and a navigation menu, perfect to display links to legal notes.
